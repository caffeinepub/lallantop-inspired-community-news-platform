  "summary": "Multilingual community-driven news platform rebranded to 'Global Nexus', founded by Pawnesh Kumar Singh. Features include a dense multi-column homepage with horizontal top nav, breaking news ticker, Hindi/English manual language toggle, citizen journalism public page, community comments, personalized feeds, multimedia section (YouTube embeds, podcast links, short-form content), and admin/editor accounts for official publishing. Platform color scheme updated to blue (#1A6FBF), black (#1a1a1a), and white. Logo replaced with uploaded Global Nexus logo. About/Founder page added in the footer featuring Pawnesh Kumar Singh's bio and photo. Privacy Policy (/privacy) and Terms of Service (/terms) pages added with full legal text, styled in blue/black theme, linked from footer alongside About link. Backend seed data updated with 2–4 new articles per category and new multimedia items. Role-based auth system being added: Admin assigns roles (Admin, Writer, Editor, Publisher) to Principal IDs via the Admin Dashboard; the system auto-generates a unique custom ID for each assigned user. Single unified /dashboard route adapts its content based on the logged-in user's assigned role. Nav shows auto-generated ID, role badge, and copyable Principal ID after login. PWA conversion in progress: manifest.json, service worker, PWA meta tags, app icons, and install prompt support being added to make the platform installable on Android/iOS home screens with full offline caching.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "AI-generated news uses rich placeholder/mock content — architecture is ready to plug in live AI/translation APIs later",
    "No real-time WebSockets; breaking news ticker and comments use refresh-based updates",
    "Multimedia section uses embedded external content (YouTube, podcast links) rather than direct file uploads",
    "Platform logo uses user-uploaded logo.png (Global Nexus branding) rather than a generated image",
    "Role system is admin-assigned only (no self-registration); backend stores Principal → { autoId: Text, role: Role } with auto-generated IDs like writer_001",
    "PWA layer adds manifest.json + service worker for offline caching and home screen installability on Android/iOS; all existing features remain server-driven and online-first"
